# ****World Happiness Report - Comprehensive Data Analysis****

**By Christopher Iloka**

## **1\. Dataset Overview**

The World Happiness dataset includes **169 countries**, grouped into **11 regions**, covering **2015 to 2019**. The dashboard tracks:

- Happiness Score
- GDP per Capita
- Social Support
- Healthy Life Expectancy
- Life Expectancy Contribution
- Freedom
- Generosity
- Perceptions of Corruption
- Confidence Intervals (Lower CI and Upper CI)

The global summaries shown in the visuals include:

- **Average Happiness Score:** 5.38
- **Life Expectancy Contribution:** 0.61
- **Sum of GDP per Capita:** 716.35
- **Time Span:** 5 years

These indicators allow you to study global well-being from both a statistical and regional perspective.

## **2\. Key Analytical Findings**

### ****2.1 Top 10 Happiest Countries****

The bar chart highlights the top countries, including:

- Denmark
- Norway
- Finland
- Switzerland
- Iceland
- Netherlands
- Canada
- Sweden
- New Zealand

**Insight:**  
These nations show long-term stability. They repeatedly appear in top rankings thanks to strong institutions, high trust, social safety nets, and low corruption.

### ****2.2 Global Happiness Trend (2015-2019)****

The line chart covering yearly averages shows:

- 2015: 5.376
- 2016: 5.382
- 2017: 5.354
- 2018: 5.382
- 2019: 5.407

**What the chart reveals:**  
A small dip in 2017 is visible, followed by a steady recovery. Overall, the trend is stable, matching SQL findings that global happiness rarely moves sharply unless major events occur.

### ****2.3 Long-Term Average Happiness by Country****

The dashboard and SQL analysis both point to consistent leaders such as Finland, Denmark, Switzerland, Iceland, and Netherlands.

**Insight:**  
Long-term averages help filter out temporary spikes. These countries stay on top because of strong social equality and reliable governance.

### ****2.4 Countries With the Largest Change (2015 → 2019)****

Using SQL, improvement and decline were measured over the five-year period.

**Insights:**

- **Improving countries** tend to show gains in stability or economic reforms.
- **Declining countries** usually face political conflict, corruption, or economic pressure.

Although the dashboard focuses on static averages, the SQL work adds context by showing direction of change.

### ****2.5 GDP per Capita Analysis****

The dataset's GDP values (summed at 716.35 in the dashboard) help identify wealthy countries.

**Insight:**  
High GDP contributes to happiness but doesn't guarantee it. Some wealthy countries still score lower due to distrust, inequality, or governance issues.

### ****2.6 Social Support Leaders****

SQL analysis highlights countries with the strongest community support systems.

**Insight:**  
Social support is one of the strongest predictors of happiness. Even countries with moderate GDP can achieve high happiness when support networks are strong.

### ****2.7 Regional Happiness Patterns****

The bar charts on all three dashboard pages point to clear regional differences:

Highest regional averages:

- Australia & New Zealand
- North America
- Western Europe
- Latin America and the Caribbean

Lowest:

- Central and Eastern Europe
- Middle East & North Africa
- Sub-Saharan Africa

**What the chart shows:**  
Regions with stable governments, strong economies, and better healthcare consistently score higher.

### ****2.8 Life Expectancy by Region (Pie Charts)****

Both the dashboard and SQL findings confirm:

- Western Europe, North America, and Oceania dominate the life expectancy contributions.
- Sub-Saharan Africa and parts of MENA have the lowest shares.

**Chart interpretation:**  
The pie charts make the health gap between regions easy to see. Higher life expectancy aligns closely with higher happiness.

### ****2.9 Confidence Interval (CI) Analysis****

The grouped bars compare:

- Lower CI
- Upper CI
- Score

Countries like Denmark, Switzerland, Norway, Finland, and Iceland show narrow CI ranges.

**Insight:**  
A small CI range means the country's ranking is stable and reliable. These visuals confirm that the top countries aren't just scoring high - they're consistently high.

### ****2.10 Healthy Life Expectancy vs GDP per Capita****

A dual-line comparison is shown for countries such as Japan, Singapore, Israel, Canada, Sweden, Australia, and several European nations.

**What the chart shows:**  
Most countries follow the same pattern: higher GDP equals higher healthy life expectancy.  
Exceptions reveal efficient health systems despite modest income levels.

### ****2.11 Freedom and Corruption Indicators (SQL Findings)****

- Freedom tends to correlate with higher happiness.
- Countries with low corruption generally score higher.
- Outliers show that freedom alone isn't enough without economic or social stability.

The dashboard doesn't display these metrics directly, but SQL insights add depth to the interpretation.

### ****2.12 Country-Specific Example: Finland****

SQL results show Finland's long-term stability at the top of global rankings.

**Insight:**  
Continuous high performance reflects strong public services, trust in institutions, and balanced socioeconomic development.

## **3\. Summary of Chart Interpretations**

- **Bar charts** show clear rankings by country and region.
- **Line charts** reveal year-to-year stability with mild fluctuations.
- **Pie charts** highlight regional disparities in life expectancy.
- **Grouped bars** present confidence intervals, helping judge ranking reliability.
- **Combined metric visuals** help connect happiness score with life expectancy and GDP.

Together, all visuals give a rounded view of global well-being.

## **4\. Overall Patterns**

- Northern Europe dominates global happiness rankings.
- Social support, freedom, trust, and good governance have stronger influence than raw GDP.
- Wealth matters, but only when combined with fairness, safety, and strong community life.
- Global happiness is broadly stable year-to-year.
- Regions like Sub-Saharan Africa and MENA face deep structural challenges.

## **5\. Final Conclusion**

The combined dashboard and SQL insights create a full picture of global happiness. The world's happiest countries score high not just because they are wealthy, but because they pair economic strength with trust, strong social support, and good governance.

The five-year trend shows steady global well-being with some variation, while the regional charts highlight deep inequalities.
